# sls-snippets
SLS Snippets is a free, lightweight WordPress plugin for embedding live HTML/CSS/JS anywhere via shortcode or Gutenberg block. It solves the hassle of showing interactive code in WordPress without external playgrounds or theme conflictsâ€”each snippet renders in a sandboxed iframe, loads only when needed, and supports optional external libraries.
