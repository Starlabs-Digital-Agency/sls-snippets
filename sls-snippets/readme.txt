CodePen-style snippets inside WordPress. Compose HTML/CSS/JS with optional Pug, Babel (TS/JSX), and SCSS via client-side compilers running in Web Workers. Embed via shortcode or block. Sandboxed iframe + CSP for safety.

[sls_snippet id="123" height="420" autorun="true"]

== Notes ==
- This build supports **plain HTML/CSS/JS** only (no Pug/SCSS/TypeScript/JSX/TSX compilers).
- Use the **SLS Snippets â†’ Help** page in WP Admin for usage, embedding, and troubleshooting tips.
